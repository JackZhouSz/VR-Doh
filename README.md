## System Requirements

Currently tested only on Meta Quest 3. Support for other VR headset models requires manual adjustment of related settings.

## Getting Started

The scene is pre-configured. To quickly experience VR-Doh, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the project**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Simulation-Intelligence/VR-Doh
    ```

2. **Add project to Unity**

    - In Unity Hub, select **"Add" → "Add project from disk"**
    - Select the cloned folder

3. **Install and configure Meta Quest Link**

    - Ensure Meta Quest Link is installed on your PC
    - Connect properly with Quest 3

4. **Configure Quest Link settings**

    - In **Settings → Beta**, enable **"Developer Runtime Features"** and all related options
    - In **Settings → General**, ensure **"Set Meta Quest Link as the active OpenXR Runtime"** is checked

5. **Open Unity project**

    - If errors occur during the process, select **"Ignore"**
    - If prompted about Oculus input changes requiring restart, select **"Restart"**

6. **Load the scene**

    - Open `Assets/Scenes/MPM 88_UI2` scene

7. **Run the project**

    - Ensure your PC and Quest 3 are properly connected with Quest Link mode active
    - Click **"Play"** at the top of the screen in Unity to enter

## Code Architecture

### Physics Simulation Core

The main physics simulation is implemented in: `scripts/mpm3D_gaussian_part.kernel.py`

This part uses **Taichi** to compile kernels into AOT modules (default location:  `Assets/Resources/TaichiModules/mpm3DGaussian_part_mat.kernel.tcm`).

In Unity, the module is imported via C# with main code in:
`Assets/Scripts/Mpm3DMarching.cs`

### Parameter Configuration

While users can adjust various parameters through the UI after launching the scene, some parameters are not yet exposed. Currently, all algorithms and parameters mentioned in the paper can be adjusted through the following method:

- `Test_Example_1` and `Test_Example_2` in the scene are the default startup objects.
- You can **pre-adjust parameters** in their **Mpm 3D Marching** component in the Unity Editor.

#### Common Parameters

- **Render Type:**
  - Select *Marching Cubes* for modeling from scratch
  - Select *Gaussian Splats* for editing 3D-GS models

- If using *Gaussian Splats*:
  - Enable the **Gaussian Splat Renderer** component on the object
  - Select a target Asset (created via `Tools → Gaussian Splats → CreateGaussianSplatAsset`)
  - Ensure **quality is set to very high**

- **Decoupling of physical and appearance representations:**
  - Enable `Use_gaussian_acceleration`
  - Adjust `Gaussian_simulate_ratio`
